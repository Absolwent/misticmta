    * Draft resource by Eddie Eezo <eddie.eezo@gmail.com>
    * 
    * When one car is driving behind another, it will experience less air resistance, making it 
    * possible to reach higher speeds more easily or even overtake the car in front. That is what
    * this resource tries to simulate - a nice little asset to race gamemodes, but also really fun
    * for simply cruising around with fast cars.
    * Permission is hereby granted to use and modify this code in any way you want, just please don't
    * re-release it and claim it to be your own.
